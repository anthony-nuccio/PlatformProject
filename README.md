Hello, everyone.

Welcome to the Github Repo for our final project for CSC 2053 | Platform Based Computing. Here you can find all files, code, edits, commits, and other information involved in the development process for this website.

The editors of this repository are:
~ Owen Korz
~ Ralph Gatdula
~ Anthony Nuccio

The design of this website is simple. The browser will prompt the user to input their current emotional state / feeling (i.e. happy, sad, etc.). The website will process the information the retrieve a movie based on their emotion. It is achievied using a free, open-sourced movie API.

The website is coded in the following languages:
~ HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
~ Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
~ JavaScript
~ Python

We elected to utilize Python instead of PHP for several reasons, primarily due to its core functionality. Given it's prominent usage in areas of Machine Learning and Data Analytics, it would be best equipped for reccomending movies based on the user's mood. It is similar to Spotify's algorithms that reccomend similar songs based on a user's favorites, which are all written in Python.

Due to out choice to use Python for back-end, server-side programming, the website will be developed using the Django web framework, as it encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
